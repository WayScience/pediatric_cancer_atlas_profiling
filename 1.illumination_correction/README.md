# Illumination correction

In this module, we create LoadData CSVs to use in CellProfiler and generate illumination correction functions per channel to apply in the next pipeline.
We also extract whole image quality metrics per plate as CSVs to use in the next module to determine thresholds for determining good versus poor quality images.
